      <abstract>From 2010-2018 we investigated the occurrence of avian influenza virus in wild birds in Iceland. A total of 6635 swabs samples were collected from wild birds or fecal material directly associated with wild birds. We screened all samples by a real time - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test with 381 testing positive. Further testing of all RT-PCR positive samples and all negative samples collected in 2012 by virus isolation yielded 120 positives, with 92 of those testing positive by RT-PCR for avian influenza virus.</abstract>
      <purpose>The data were collected to investigate the presence of avian influenza viruses in Iceland bird species to better understand the role migratory birds have in the movement of avian influenza viruses between the North American continent and the European Continent. Iceland sits within the East Atlantic Migratory Bird Flyway with birds that use the flyway breeding in Greenland and Northern Canada and winter along the European Continent into Africa. In these breeding and wintering areas they have the opportunity to mix with avian species that use other flyways either to migrate south into North America in the winter or north into other parts of Europe or Asia in the summers making Iceland an appropriate middle ground to investigate this hypothesized virus movement in migratory birds. This data can be used to understand the prevalence of avian influenza virus in the migratory birds sampled in Iceland by species, age class, season, or other variables reported and within the limitations of the sampling methods. The genetic data from the avian influenza viruses can be used to compare among other avian influenza viruses globally to better understand the relationships among these viruses and how they spread geographically.</purpose>

        <procdesc>Field sample collection
From May 2010 through February 2018, we obtained IAV isolates from various species of seabirds, shorebirds, and waterfowl as well as environmental sampling of avian fecal material from locations throughout Iceland. Live sampled birds were captured using a 18m x 12m cannon-propelled capture net, noose pole, or hand capture. Birds found dead or moribund were also sampled. Hunter-harvested waterfowl and fisheries-bycatch seabirds were sampled as available. All birds were identified to species and, for live birds, individually marked with metal bands if available (in some cases bands were not available of the appropriate size). Age characteristics were determined and age was documented for each bird: hatched in same calendar year as sampling (1CY), hatched previous calendar year (2CY), hatched previous calendar year or older, exact age unknown (2CY+), three calendar years since hatching (3CY), four calendar years since hatching (4CY), more than four calendar years since hatching (4CY+), or unknown if age could not be determined (U) (Olsen KM, 2004; Prater, Marchant, &amp; Vuorinen, 1977; USGS, 2020). Due to species specific differences, not all aging categories could be applied to all species sampled. All live birds were immediately released following completion of sampling.

To sample for IAV, a single polyester-tipped swab was used to swab the cloaca only (2010-2013) or to first swab the oral cavity then the cloaca (2014-2017). Opportunistic environmental sampling of fecal material was also conducted using a direct swabbing method (2018). Each swab sample was immediately placed in individual cryovials containing 1.25 ml viral transport media (Docherty &amp; Slota, 1988). Vials were held on ice for up to 5 hours prior to being stored in liquid nitrogen or liquid nitrogen vapor. Samples were shipped on dry ice from Iceland to Madison, Wisconsin, USA by private courier with dry ice replenishment during shipping. Once received in the laboratory, samples were stored at -80o C until analysis.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Virus extraction, RT-PCR, virus isolation
Viral RNA was extracted from swab samples using the MagMAXTM-96 AI/ND Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer’s procedures. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using previously published procedures, primers, and probes (Spackman et al., 2002) designed to detect the IAV matrix gene. RT-PCR assays utilized reagents provided in the Qiagen OneStep® RT-PCR kit. Virus isolation was performed in embryonating chicken egg culture on all swab samples exhibiting positive Ct values from RT-PCR analysis (Woolcock, 2008), with a primary cut off value of 45 on primary screen and 22 on secondary screen. Egg-grown virus isolates and a single sample that exhibited a low Ct value but had no virus isolated were sequenced using multiple standard methods including Sanger, Roche 454, and Illumina (HiSeq 2000 and MiSeq) sequencing (Dusek et al., 2014; Guan et al., 2019; Hall et al., 2014). Resulting sequences deposited in GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/).</procdesc>
