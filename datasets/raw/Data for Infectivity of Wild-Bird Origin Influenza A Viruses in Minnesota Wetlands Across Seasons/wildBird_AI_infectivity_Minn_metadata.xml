        <procdesc>STEP 1 - Water chemistry analysis:

A multiparameter water quality sonde (Yellow Springs Instruments [YSI], Yellow Springs, Ohio) was used in situ to measure field parameters including pH, temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen (DO). In addition, approximately 700mL of both unfiltered and 0.45µm filtered water was also collected from each waterbody in the field, at initiation of the trial [8/26/2020] and sent to the USGS Redox Chemistry Laboratory (Boulder, CO) for further chemical characterization with a Sievers Nitric Oxide analyzer, Dionex ICS-5000 Ion chromatograph, and Formacs Total nitrogen analyzer. Water chemistry analyses were led by Laura Hubbard (USGS Upper Midwest Science Center). Methods were derived from Ramey et al. 2022.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20200901</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>STEP 2 - Collection of swab samples from wild mallards and sample preparation: 

Four sites for a field experiment were chosen at locations previously utilized for wild bird influenza A virus (IAV) surveillance and research. Surface water was collected from each location, filtered to 0.22µm to remove particulates and bacteria, and kept chilled at 4 degrees Celsius. Filtered water from each site was dispensed into 800 4mL cryovials at 1.8mL volume. Distilled water was also aliquoted into 800 4mL cryovials at 1.8mL volume at the laboratory  prior to field work, kept cold, and transported to the Minnesota field lab where it was then used for aliquots of duck swab materials.

Paired cloacal and oropharyngeal (CL/OP) swabs were collected from 266 live captured mallards from 25 August – 19 September 2020 and placed in 8mL cold, distilled water. Swabs in distilled water were kept at 4 degrees Celsius until processing, at which point they were vortexed and supernatants aliquoted at 195uL volume into four tubes of 1.8mL of 0.22µm filtered water from each waterbody plus four tubes of distilled water. One replicate aliquot of each CL/OP swab (initial timepoint [2 September – 19 September 2020], hereafter T1) was placed in filtered water from each waterbody and was immediately sent to the processing laboratory for cold storage until testing. All distilled water samples were also shipped to the processing laboratory for immediate testing (T1), or laboratory storage at 4 degrees Celsius. All other aliquots of CL/OP swabs in filtered water (hereafter T2, T3, and T4) from all water bodies (A, B, C, or D) were deployed in the environment. Two replicate negative control tubes (filtered natural water only) from each site for quality assurance were also included for T1 sample processing. Sample extraction was led by Rebecca Poulson (University of Georgia). Methods were derived from Ramey et al. 2022.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20200919</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>STEP 3 - RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription PCR (rrt-pcr): 

Viral RNA was extracted from the swab samples using a commercially available magnetic bead kit (MagMax, Thermofisher) on an automated Kingfisher Duo using the manufacturer's protocol. With every extraction, positive and negative controls were used. Extracted RNA was tested for the Matrix gene. The primers used to amplify the Matrix gene were as follows: "M+25" 5'-AGATGAGTCTTCTAACCGAGGTCG-3', "M-124" 5'-TGCAAAAACATCTTCAAGTCTCTG-3'. Amplified target was detected with a FAM intercalated probe with the sequence: 5'-TCAGGCCCCCTCAAAGCCGA-3'. Master mix for the qPCR included reagents in the AgPath-ID One-step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) and the aforementioned primers and probe in the following volumes per reaction: reaction buffer, 12.5μL; M+25 primer (20uM), 0.25μL; M-124 primer (20uM), 0.25μL; probe (6uM), 0.25μL; 25x RT-PCR enzyme, 1μL; detection enhancer, 1.67μL; nanopure water, 1.08uL, sample RNA, 8uL. Thermal cycling conditions on an Applied Biosystems 7500Fast real time quantitative PCR machine were: 10 minutes 45°C, 10 minutes 94°C, followed by 45 cycles of 1 second denaturation at 94°C and 30 seconds annealing at 60°C, with fluorescence data collected at the annealing step. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were automatically generated by the thermal cycler.

All distilled water samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) values less than 45 were considered positive for IAV viral RNA; virus isolation (VI) in embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) was also carried out on all T1 distilled water samples. Briefly, prior to VI, each tube of water was dosed with antibiotic/antimycotic solution (penicillin G: 200 units/mL, Streptomycin: 0.2 mg/mL, and Amphotericin B: 0.5 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), vortexed vigorously and centrifuged at 3000 rpm x 15 minutes. Approximately 1.0mL of supernatant was then evenly divided into the amnioallantoic cavity of three ECE and allowed to incubate at 37 degrees Celsius for 5 days. Amnioallantoic fluids were tested via hemagglutination assay (HA) with 0.5 percent chicken red blood cells; nucleic acids were extracted from all HA positive samples and then screened in rrt-PCR targeting IAV matrix gene as described.

When IAV was detected by rrt-PCR and/or by VI in distilled water samples, all replicate mesocosm samples were then subjected to VI, as described above, approximately one week later. Additionally, 51 of 65 distilled water samples that were IAV VI positive at T1 were also subjected to end-point titration in ECE one to two weeks after initial VI, and median egg infectious dose (EID50/mL) was calculated for each. The minimum detectable limit for this procedure is 100.8 EID50/mL. Rebecca Poulson (University of Georgia) led the viral extraction process. Methods were derived from Ramey et al. 2022.</procdesc>
        <procdate>20200930</procdate>
      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>STEP 4 - Assessment of viral viability in mesocosms: 

A perforated steel drum containing a Hobo® TidbiT® temperature logger (Onset Computer Corp; Bourne, MA, USA) was deployed into each waterbody at a depth of approximately 1 meter as has been previously described. Replicate sample tubes for T2, T3, and T4 were contained within mesh bags inside each drum in each water body and deployed between 3 September and 19 September 2020; all tubes were held at 4 degrees Celsius from point of collection, aliquoting of swab materials, and until deployment into the environment. Quality assurance/control samples included one tube of uninoculated filtered water for each water body (A – D) for retrieval at T2 and T3. Replicate samples were retrieved at three ecologically relevant timepoints: ice formation T2 (26 October 2020, 38-62 days post initial sample collection [dpi]); ice out T3 (8 April 2021; 202-226 dpi); and summer T4 (24 June 2021; 279-303 dpi). After collection of samples for each timepoint T2, and T3, care was taken to confirm that the drum was still properly anchored at appropriate depth (approximately 1m) in the waterbody. The steel drum and all contents, including the HOBO data logger were removed from each waterbody at the conclusion of the study (T4).  All T2, T3, and T4 samples were sent on ice packs to the processing lab immediately after retrieval. All distilled water samples were removed from 4 degrees Celsius in the lab within 0-18 days of field sample retrieval (T2: 0-18 days; T3: 0-6days; T4: 0-8days). To account for potential heterogeneity across samples, at T2, all replicates (A – D and distilled water) were subjected to VI in ECE if any replicate (A – D and/or distilled water) was IAV rrt-PCR or hemagglutination (described in Process Step 3) assay positive at T1. T3 and T4 samples were treated similarly, if any replicates were IAV rrt-PCR or hemagglutination assay positive at the previous timepoint, VI was performed for all replicate treatments for that swab sample.

The persistence of a duck-derived, egg-propagated LP H3N8 virus held in filtered waters under cold conditions in the laboratory (approximately 4 degrees Celsius, refrigerator) was assessed to refine inference on variability in viral persistence among water bodies. Briefly, 500mL of each 0.22um filtered natural water was brought into the laboratory and spiked with approximately 104 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/mL of first ECE passage A/mallard/Minnesota/2018(H3N8); a volume of distilled water was also spiked at the same approximate concentration. Spiked waters (filtered and distilled) were then aliquoted at 1mL volume into individual-use snap-cap tubes, and to maintain surrounding temperature, placed in a plastic container filled with water in a laboratory refrigerator at approximately 4 C. Samples were titrated on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK, CCL-34, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia) upon experimental set up and then every 7 – 39 days until the conclusion of the trial at 241 days; viral titers were calculated. Linear regression was used to determine a 90% reduction time (Rt) for each treatment that demonstrated more than a 1 log10 TCID50/mL reduction in viral titer. Rt values correspond to the time required for a 1log10 TCID50/mL decrease in viral titer. The minimum detectable limit for this procedure is 101.77 TCID50/mL. Methods were derived from Ramey et al. 2022.</procdesc>

      </procstep>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>STEP 5 - Sequencing: 

All samples with positive viral isolation results from the each timepoint and mesocosm, underwent RNA extraction, as described in Process Step 3, and were amplified for the influenza A genome with reverse transcription PCR for sequencing. The consensus 5' and 3' influenza A primers are: "MBTuni-12" 5'-ACGCGTGATCAGCRAAAGCAGG-3' and "MBTuni-13" 5'-ACGCGTGATCAGTAGAAACAAGG-3'. Master mix for the PCR was made using reagents from the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq high Fidelity (Invitrogen) and the previously listed primers in the following volumes per reaction: 2x reaction mix, 12.5uL; Superscript III RT Platinum Taq Mix, 0.5uL; MBTuni-12 (10uM), 0.5uL; MBTuni-13 (10uM), 0.5uL; nanopure water, magnesium sulfate (5mM), 1uL; RNAse inhibitor (13.3U/uL), 0.5uL; sample RNA, 2uL. Thermal cycling conditions on a Bio-Rad T100 were: 60 minutes 42°C, 2 minutes 94°C, 5 cycles of 15 seconds 94°C denaturing, 30 seconds 45°C annealing, and 3 minutes 68°C extensions, 30 cycles of 15 seconds 94°C denaturing, 30 seconds 57°C annealing, 3 minutes 68°C extension, and a final extension for 3 minutes at 68°C. PCR product was prepared for sequencing using the Nextera XT Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) following manufacturer's instructions, and sequenced on a MiSeq (Illumina).

Illumina adapter sequences were trimmed from raw reads using Trimmomatic and default settings.  Burrows-Wheeler aligner was used to map trimmed reads to 55 influenza A virus reference genome segments that were selected to represent genetically diverse viruses from North America and Eurasia. Consensus sequences were generated for each gene segment based on highest reference genome coverage and a Bayesian heterozygous consensus calling algorithm was selected for nucleotide assignment using SAMtools. Sequencing was led by Laura Scott (USGS Alaska Science Center). Methods were derived from Ramey et al. 2022.</procdesc>
