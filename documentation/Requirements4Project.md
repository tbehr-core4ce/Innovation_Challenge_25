Bio-Event Tracking System (BETS) Prototype

Background and Objective

The recent transmission of HPAI A(H5N1) bird flu from dairy cows to humans marks a

critical juncture in public health management. With sporadic human cases being reported,

there is an urgent need for innovative solutions to enhance the monitoring, management,

and mitigation of this virus, particularly in preventing its transmission to humans.

The management of H5N1 bird flu outbreaks requires a comprehensive and integrated

approach to synthesize data from multiple sources into a cohesive operational picture.

Currently, disparate data sets related to avian and other animal populations, human

health cases, environmental factors, and resource availability are underutilized due to

their fragmented nature. This hampers effective decision-making and timely intervention.

The government requires a functional, interactive prototype – the Bio-Event Tracking

System (BETS)—that combines disparate H5N1 data sources into a unified platform, with

the goal of better managing and mitigating the spread of bird flu, ultimately protecting both

animal and human populations.

The solutions should focus on using data analysis and visualization to:

• Enhance situational awareness via real-time surveillance of H5N1 cases,

• Support strategic decision-making related to resource allocation; and,

• Empower public health agencies to communicate accurate, timely, and critical

health alerts to the public

The Government is not seeking a production-ready enterprise system but a working proof

of concept that illustrates how commercially available technologies, low-code/no-code

tools, or hybrid approaches can fulfill these requirements within a limited timeframe.


The Bio-Event Tracking System (BETS)—should be designed to:

1. 2. 3. 4. Ingest and integrate multiple categories of open-source biological, environmental,

and epidemiological data.

Detect and display abnormal patterns or emerging hotspots through maps, charts,

and dashboards.

Track and update event progression in real time or near real time.

Communicate findings clearly through visual summaries suitable for operational

briefings or decision forums.

Successful submissions will illustrate how a rapid software prototype can transform raw data into operational insight. Platforms should prioritize clarity, usability, and visual impact for non-technical decisionmakers.
