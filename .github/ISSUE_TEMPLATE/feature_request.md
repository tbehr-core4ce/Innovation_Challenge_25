### 1. What problem or opportunity does this address?
*In a sentence or two, tell us what’s wrong now or what could be better.*  
Example: “When I create a report I have to manually copy data into Excel and it takes 20 min.”

### 2. What is your idea or request?
*Describe the feature you’d like to see.*  
Try to keep it simple: what should happen instead of the current state?

### 3. How will you know it’s successful?
*What change or result would let you say “Yes — this works”?”*  
Example: “I can generate the report with one click and it takes ≤ 2 minutes.”

### 4. Have you thought of any alternatives?
*If you’ve considered other ways, write them here.*  
Example: “We thought about automating Excel macros but decided it’s too brittle.”

### 5. Who will use this, and how often?
*This helps us understand priority and effort.*  
Example: “All analysts in the finance team, daily” or “Occasional use once a quarter”.
